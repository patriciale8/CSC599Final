Overview:
This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict hospital treatment costs based on clinical and demographic data. By leveraging models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, we aim to deliver insights that can aid healthcare providers in cost management and planning.

Features
Dataset: Utilizes the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) dataset.
Data Processing: Handles missing data, feature selection, and categorical variable encoding.
Machine Learning Models: Includes Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
Evaluation Metrics: R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used for performance evaluation.
Deliverables: A trained ML model and detailed analysis of hospital cost prediction.
Project Workflow
Data Understanding

Dataset: Open-source CSV files with clinical and demographic variables.
Overview: Includes dependent variables (hospital costs) and independent features.
Data Preprocessing

Missing data handling.
Encoding categorical variables using one-hot or label encoding.
Feature selection based on domain knowledge and statistical techniques.
Model Development

Implement Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV.
Evaluation

Metrics: R² and MSE.
Comparison of model performance.
Deployment

Future plans for deploying the model as a REST API or on cloud platforms.
